This was a surprisingly tough project mainly because, on 2 occasions, I ran into a situation I hadn't come across before. This was that I understood what my code was doing but couldn't work out why it wasn't working. I'm happy that I managed to troubleshoot my own way into fixing these bugs and gave me some more confidence in my coding.

I thought about creating the divs in JavaScript but I wanted the type of stream (e.g. Rainbow 6 Stream) to be hardcoded. I would like to refactor this code without having so many IDs all over the place, there must be a way to do it using class names.
