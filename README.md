## Twitch TV -  A Free Code Camp project

This is the 4th of the "Intermediate" projects in the old FreeCodeCamp curriculum. 
I think the vanilla JS version was relatively straight forward given the 
similarity with the Wikipedia project. 

I learnt a lot from the React version of this project, mainly around how to render from
initial state and then update state to rerender the streams with live data. I
struggled with structuring the hardcoded data and passing that into state as an
object of objects. Once I had tackled that though, the rest was easy enough.

**User Stories:**
- [x] I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.
- [x] I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's
 Twitch.tv channel.
- [x] If a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details
about what they are streaming.

**Main Lessons Learnt:**
* Using Twitch API
* Updating hardcoded data
* Mapping over and displaying the response data 

**Getting Started:**
 1. Run: `npm install`
 2. Run: `npm start` 
 3. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/`
